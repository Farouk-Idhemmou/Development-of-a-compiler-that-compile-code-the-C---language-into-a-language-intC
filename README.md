***The main code is in tha Compiler_Code.cbp .
***Other files.txt are file tests for each part of the project .


***Open the Compiler_Code.cbp in a C++ IDE  and run it . and test each file by replacing name of file in the file "exemple.txt" in the main function.
***the compiler will detect error of (lexical, syntactic, and semantic). 

***Here is a description of the project:
   
    The aim of this project is to develop a compiler that takes input code written in the C-- language,
    which is a subset of C, and translates it into another intermediate language called intC.
    This compiler will be implemented in C++. The major steps of our project include lexical,
    syntactic, and semantic phases. The Lexical phase analyzes and organizes the words or symbols
    of a source language into lexical tokens to facilitate understanding by the rest of the compiler 
    during the translation process into machine language. The Syntactic phase analyzes the grammatical
    structure of source programs to verify their compliance with the syntax rules of the programming language.
    The Semantic phase assigns meaning to the structures and expressions of the source language by verifying
    their compliance with the rules and producing a consistent intermediate representation for code generation. 

***Perspectives of the project :
    We are looking forward to adding the code generation part for this project.
